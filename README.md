# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge I utilized a GeoJson url to capture the position of an earthquake with different features and displayed the earthquakes on a map. The size of each circle marker is based on magnitude and the color is based on the depth. See leaflet-map-image in the images folder to see a snap shot of the map. Run the index.html in this git hub to interact with the map. See the logic.js in the static folder to see how the map and markers are build.
